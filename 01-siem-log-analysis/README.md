# SIEM Log Analysis – Splunk Blue Team Lab

This lab demonstrates SIEM log analysis and security event investigation using Splunk. The focus of this exercise is to identify abnormal activity patterns across authentication logs, system events, and application logs, then aggregate results using SPL queries for threat detection and triage.

## Objectives
- Perform SIEM log analysis using Splunk
- Identify failed authentication trends and suspicious activity
- Use SPL to aggregate, filter, and visualize log data
- Build a repeatable investigation workflow

## Techniques Used
- Log aggregation & field extraction
- Statistics-based anomaly detection
- Event pattern analysis
- Security investigation queries (SPL)

## Key SPL Queries
Examples include:
- Failed authentication pattern detection  
- Suspicious process execution search  
- Host and source-based event aggregation  

(See `/documents` for PDF query reports)

## Evidence Included
- 📂 `/screenshots` – Result views from Splunk searches  
- 📂 `/documents` – PDF versions of investigation queries and findings  

## Learning Outcome
This lab strengthened my ability to:
- Analyze SIEM event data
- Detect suspicious activity using SPL
- Interpret event statistics for threat triage
