# Brute Force, Phishing, and Malware Indicator Hunting – Splunk Lab

This lab focuses on hunting brute-force behavior, phishing activity, and malware-related indicators using Splunk queries. The investigation recreates real-world SOC detections by filtering event logs for security keywords, URLs, and execution patterns.

## Objectives
- Detect brute-force and credential abuse attempts
- Identify phishing-related artifacts in logs
- Search for malware keywords and execution traces
- Build detection logic using SPL

## Detection Categories
- 🔐 Authentication brute-force attempts
- 🎣 Phishing keyword & URL detection
- 🦠 Malware keyword and IOC discovery

## Analysis Techniques
- Keyword-based hunting
- Source and host frequency analysis
- URL and process inspection
- IOC-driven log queries

## Evidence Included
- 📂 `/screenshots` – Hunt results and query output  
- 📂 `/documents` – PDF reports showing SPL logic and findings  

## Learning Outcome
This lab improved my ability to:
- Pivot between different attack types
- Identify malicious indicators in event data
- Build structured detection workflows in Splunk
