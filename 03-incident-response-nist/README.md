# Incident Response Investigation – NIST Framework (Splunk Lab)

This lab aligns with the NIST Incident Response lifecycle and demonstrates how Splunk can be used to support alert triage, investigation, and evidence collection during a security event.

## NIST Phases Covered
- Detection & Analysis
- Containment, Eradication & Recovery
- Post-Incident Activity (evidence & review)

## Objectives
- Validate alerts using Splunk event searches
- Investigate failure volume & suspicious activity
- Review timelines and event statistics
- Document investigation results as incident evidence

## Techniques Used
- Alert validation & trigger inspection
- Timeline reconstruction
- Source & host aggregation statistics
- Event correlation for impact analysis

## Evidence Included
- `/screenshots` – Investigation timeline, query results, and alert trigger views  
- `/documents` – NIST investigation documentation and supporting material  

## Learning Outcome
This lab demonstrates practical experience in:
- Using Splunk during incident response
- Applying the NIST IR framework to SOC workflows
- Collecting evidence for post-incident reporting
